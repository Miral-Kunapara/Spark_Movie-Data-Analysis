# Spark_Movie-Data-Analysis
This project utilizes Google Dataproc as my Hadoop cluster to efficiently  store movie datasets in Hadoop. Through the use of PySpark, comprehensive data analysis was performed, resulting in the creation of DataFrames for all datasets. This setup enables efficient data processing and insightful analysis.

## Tasks

1. Data Loading: Set the foundation by loading data into the Hadoop cluster.

2. Data Exploration: Delved into the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

3. Aggregations: Performed essential aggregations to gain high-level insights.

4. Optimized Joins: Ensured seamless merging of tables for comprehensive analysis.

5. Window Function: Employed window functions for nuanced data manipulation.

6. Advanced Aggregations: Unearthed deeper insights through advanced aggregation techniques.

7. Complex Joins and Aggregations: Tackled complex data relationships with finesse.

8. Performance Tuning: Fine-tuned the entire process for optimal performance.
